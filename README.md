# Assignment2
As the last assignment I clean up my disk and lost my work ,I do not work well on the assignment1. this time I get sufficient time to work out assignment2
 Looking into the assignment description, Person is obvious the basic class of YoungChildren Children and Adult. And the number of their relation types are increasing ï¼ŒThus we just need to extends the class one by one. of course, the accessors and mutators are necessary in these class.

the most difficult part of the code is GUI, which is really difficult for new birds. firstly design with paper and design the GUI I want to use. I want to list all guys on the left part of the windows and connect(bind) it to a list, and the change of list could be seen at once. If I click the person ,his information would be displayed on the right side of window.
On the other hand, I put a choose box at the information part , to display the people of the certain relation type. Finally, the ADD, DELETE and CONNECT button set under the person list. all GUI I used are designed with FXML.

There are 4 list I used . Personalist for finding out whether someone exist , the other 3 use to record people(objects, also with relation types ). Firstly complete some easy functions,  as  they may be useful in some complete function later. 

Delete function was completed first, as assignment requires use less than50 for a method, I use bit many methods. the target is find people who relate to him and delete the relation with him in both person

Add function need a new window, for people who is under 17, it is required to record the parent, also the parent will be checked whether they are legal couple.

Finally, to add relation between two guy, checked their existing relation first, and then pop up new window to make connection. the legal things are just similar to the add function.# Assignment2
